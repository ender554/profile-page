# Personal Profile and Portfolio Page

## Description

This project serves as my personal portfolio and resume page, built to showcase my skills as a front-end-focused full-stack developer. The site includes an interactive profile section and a separate page dedicated to widgets and embedded apps that demonstrate my full-stack development capabilities across various tools and technologies.

The portfolio is designed to be responsive and follows a mobile-first approach, ensuring a smooth experience across devices.

## Features

- **Profile Section**: Includes an overview of my skills, experience, and links to my external profiles (GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.).
- **Interactive Widgets**: A dedicated section showcasing embedded apps, interactive widgets, and code examples that demonstrate my proficiency with various full-stack development tools and technologies.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design that adapts to various screen sizes.

## Tech Stack

- **Front-End**: React, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3.
- **Back-End**: Node.js, Express (future addition for interactive elements with state-saving).
- **Database**: MongoDB (future addition for storing user-interaction states).
- **Testing**: Jest (for TDD).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/profile-page.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd profile-page
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash

   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.

## Contributing to the Project

### Branching Strategy

- **master**: The production-ready branch.
- **feature branches**: Feature work is done in individual feature branches (`feature/feature-name`).
- **hotfix branches**: Hotfixes go directly into `master` and `dev`.

### Guidelines

- All code must be thoroughly tested before merging into `master`.

## Usage

This project demonstrates:

- My personal profile and experience as a developer.
- Various widgets and embedded apps that highlight my full-stack development capabilities.
- Future additions include server-side functionality and state persistence.

## Roadmap

- **Add Interactive Widgets**: More embedded apps demonstrating advanced use of front-end frameworks, state management, and API integrations.
- **Back-End Integration**: Set up a back-end server (Node.js/Express) for state-saving and login functionality.
- **Database Setup**: Use MongoDB to store user states and interactions with the embedded widgets.
